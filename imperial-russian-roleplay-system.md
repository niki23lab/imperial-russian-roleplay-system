# üìú IMPERIAL RUSSIAN ROLEPLAY SYSTEM 1905 ‚Äî DETAILED DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT

## üëë CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL VISION

This document outlines the master plan for the development of an immersive historical roleplay system within the **Second Life** platform, based on Imperial Russia in the year 1905.

The primary goal is to recreate life under the reign of **Nicholas II Romanov**, including elements such as the nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie, peasantry, imperial family, and the Empire's institutions.

This HUD will be linked to scripts developed in **LSL (Linden Scripting Language)** that will control the system's logic and functions.
